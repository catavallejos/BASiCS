Description: Single-cell mRNA sequencing can uncover novel cell-to-cell
    heterogeneity in gene expression levels in seemingly homogeneous
    populations of cells. However, these experiments are prone to high levels
    of unexplained technical noise, creating new challenges for identifying
    genes that show genuine heterogeneous expression within the population of
    cells under study. BASiCS (Bayesian Analysis of Single-Cell Sequencing
    data) is an integrated Bayesian hierarchical model where: (ii)
    cell-specific normalization constants are estimated as part of the model
    parameters, (ii) technical variability is quantified based on spike-in
    genes that are artificially introduced to each analysed cells lysate and
    (iii) the total variability of the expression counts is decomposed into
    technical and biological components. BASiCS also provides an intuitive
    detection criterion for highly (or lowly) variable genes within the
    population of cells under study. This is formalized by means of tail
    posterior probabilities associated to high (or low) biological cell-to-cell
    variance contributions, quantities that can be easily interpreted by
    applied users. Additionally, BASiCS has now been extended to compare gene
    expression patterns between pre-specified populations of cells. Unlike traditional
    differential expression tools, BASiCS quantifies changes in expression that lie
    beyond comparisons of means, also allowing the study of changes in cell-to-cell
    heterogeneity. The latter are quantified via a biological over-dispersion
    parameter that measures residual over-dispersion (with respect to Poisson sampling)
    after normalisation and the removal of technical variation.
