version 0.3.0: (2015-07-31)
- New slot BacthInfo in 'BASiCS_Data' class
- Batch-speficic technical variability parameters are allowed

graphical output)

version 0.3.1: (2015-09-17)
- New slot GeneNames in 'BASiCS_Data' class
- Changes in the constructor `newBASiCS_Data` to allow easier construction of 
`BASiCS_Data` objects
- Minor changes to some functions' output to use the new GeneNames slot of 
'BASiCS_Data' class

elements related to the parameter $\theta$)

This is helpful on situations where the default value led to slow mixing to 
the chains related to the normalising constants $\phi_j$'s.

- Same method as before but improved performance of C++ code

version 0.3.4: (2015-11-11)

optional use of `gamma` or `log-normal` priors for delta. 
- In `BASiCS_MCMC` function, change of default value of `s2.mu` to 0.5. Allows
better shrinkage in situations where a gene has zero counts across all cells.
- In `BASiCS_Data` class. Count matrices where a gene has zero counts across 
all cells are now allowed. However, a warning is returned in such case. 
Only use such matrices when running differential expression results.

chains with a variety of user-defined starting point. In general, we do not 
advise to use this argument as the default option has been tuned to 
facilitate convergence.

function (removing 'GeneNames' argument)
- Updated documentation for 'BASiCS_DV_TestDE' function.
