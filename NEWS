version 0.3.0: (2015-07-31)
- New slot BacthInfo in 'BASiCS_Data' class
- Batch-speficic technical variability parameters are allowed

graphical output)

version 0.3.1: (2015-09-17)
- New slot GeneNames in 'BASiCS_Data' class
- Changes in the constructor `newBASiCS_Data` to allow easier construction of 
`BASiCS_Data` objects
- Minor changes to some functions' output to use the new GeneNames slot of 
'BASiCS_Data' class

elements related to the parameter $\theta$)

This is helpful on situations where the default value led to slow mixing to 
the chains related to the normalising constants $\phi_j$'s.

- Same method as before but improved performance of C++ code

version 0.3.4: (2015-11-11)

optional use of `gamma` or `log-normal` priors for delta. 
- In `BASiCS_MCMC` function, change of default value of `s2.mu` to 0.5. Allows
better shrinkage in situations where a gene has zero counts across all cells.
- In `BASiCS_Data` class. Count matrices where a gene has zero counts across 
all cells are now allowed. However, a warning is returned in such case. 
Only use such matrices when running differential expression results.

chains with a variety of user-defined starting point. In general, we do not 
advise to use this argument as the default option has been tuned to 
facilitate convergence.

function (removing 'GeneNames' argument)
- Updated documentation for 'BASiCS_DV_TestDE' function.

- Uses built-in chain in examples for `BASiCS_diagHist` and `BASiCS_diagPlot`

version 1.5.22 (2019-04-02)
- `HiddenCheckValidCombination`, `HiddenGeneParams` and `HiddenGeneParams`
moved from `Methods.R` to `HiddenUtils.R`
- `sapply` replaced by `vapply` in `HiddenCheckValidCombination`,  
`HiddenThresholdSearchDetectHVL_LVG.R` and `HiddenThresholdSearchTestDE.R`
- Use of `set.seed` removed from `makeExampleBASiCS_Data` 
- Unit tests updated accordingly
- Adds missing running examples to Rds in order to pass R CMD BioCheck

version 1.5.23 (2019-04-02)
- Minor edit to the documentation of `makeExampleBASiCS_Data` (explain why
a fixed seed is no longer used)

version 1.5.24 (2019-04-05)
- Minor edit to the documentation of `makeExampleBASiCS_Data` (fixed link to 
`set.seed` documentation as it led to WARNINGS in Bioc-devel)

version 1.5.25 (2019-04-07)
- Minor change in `muUpdateNoSpikes` (C++ function in `utils_MCMCNoSpikes.cpp`)
to avoid WARNINGS in bioc-devel related to integers vs unsigned integers

version 1.5.26 (2019-04-08)
- Similar changes applied to `utils_MCMCcppReg.cpp` and
`utils_MCMCcppRegNoSpikes.cpp`.

version 1.5.27 (2019-04-08)
- Edits `BASiCS_TestDE` to avoid low posterior probability thresholds derived 
from the EFDR calibration. This alters some of the related 'Hidden' functions. 
- In `BASiCS_TestDE`, default values for `EFDR_M`, `EFDR_D` and `EFDR_R` 
were changed to 0.05. 
- Unit tests updated accordingly

version 1.5.28 (2019-04-09)
- Edited version of `BASiCS_Sim` to allow no spikes and multiple batches
- Documentation updated accordingly

version 1.5.29 (2019-04-10)
- Unit test associated to `BASiCS_Sim` updated to use a fixed seed and to
check exact values being reproducible

version 1.5.30 (2019-04-11)
- `BASiCS_effectiveSize` has been created as a wrapper of `coda::effectiveSize`.
This is to resolve issues when `Param = 'epsilon'` as it contains `NA` for very
lowly expressed genes that are excluded from the mean/over-dispersion trend.

version 1.5.31 (2019-04-15)
- Updated vignette to include ERCC calculation

version 1.5.32 (2019-04-17)
- Minor change in `BASiCS_MCMC` to avoid storing adaptive variances in the
`BASiCS_Chain` object when `StoreAdapt = TRUE`. 
- New unit test to ensure the correct output in `BASiCS_Chain@parameters`
- Minor change in `Summary` method for `BASiCS_Chain` class to avoid calculating 
posterior summaries when `designMatrix` is part of the `parameters` slot
- Added `return` to the docummentation of `BASiCS_effectiveSize`. 

version 1.5.33 (2019-04-19)
- Updated ERCC formula in the vignette.

version 1.5.34 (2019-04-20)
- Fixes typo in vignette
