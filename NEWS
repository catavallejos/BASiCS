version 0.3.0: (2015-07-31)
- New slot BacthInfo in 'BASiCS_Data' class
- Batch-speficic technical variability parameters are allowed

graphical output)

version 0.3.1: (2015-09-17)
- New slot GeneNames in 'BASiCS_Data' class
- Changes in the constructor `newBASiCS_Data` to allow easier construction of 
`BASiCS_Data` objects
- Minor changes to some functions' output to use the new GeneNames slot of 
'BASiCS_Data' class

elements related to the parameter $\theta$)

This is helpful on situations where the default value led to slow mixing to 
the chains related to the normalising constants $\phi_j$'s.

- Same method as before but improved performance of C++ code

version 0.3.4: (2015-11-11)

optional use of `gamma` or `log-normal` priors for delta. 
- In `BASiCS_MCMC` function, change of default value of `s2.mu` to 0.5. Allows
better shrinkage in situations where a gene has zero counts across all cells.
- In `BASiCS_Data` class. Count matrices where a gene has zero counts across 
all cells are now allowed. However, a warning is returned in such case. 
Only use such matrices when running differential expression results.

chains with a variety of user-defined starting point. In general, we do not 
advise to use this argument as the default option has been tuned to 
facilitate convergence.

function (removing 'GeneNames' argument)
- Updated documentation for 'BASiCS_DV_TestDE' function.

version 0.99.4: (2017-09-25)
- Format in `BASiCS_MCMC`
- Minor bug fixed in `BASiCS_DetectLVG` plots
- Added examples in `BASiCS_DenoisedCounts` + `BASiCS_DenoisedRates`
- Removal of `Example` argument in `makeExampleBASiCS_D_Data`
- Format in vignette
- R CMD CHECK passed
- R CMD BiocCheck passed
  
version 0.99.5: (2017-09-26)  
- Change of default `PriorDelta` value in `BASiCS_MCMC` 
- Unit tests modified accordingly

version 0.99.6: (2017-10-05) - After @nturaga review
- `inst` folder has been deleted
- Removal of `...` arg in `segments` - `plot` method for `BASiCS_Summary`

No-spikes implementation
- `makeExampleBASiCS_Data` + `newBASiCS_Data` adapted to no-spikes case
- Temporary vignette file for no-spikes case has been created
- `HiddenBASiCS_MCMCcppNoSpikes` updated to recycle vertical integration
update functions
- Fixed bug to allow use of stochastic reference
- Fixed bug in argument order for no-spikes version
- Spikes version code clean-up
Summary of constrain types
- ConstrainType: full or subset of genes 
  * For the second case, different filter thresholds have been proposed
- StochasticRef or no 
- Idea: 
  * Try StochasticRef with no filter
  * Try StochasticRef with filter > 0 total counts

TO-DO
- Implement Giacomo's suggestion? 
  
- DEVELOPMENT NOTES (potential future changes):
  * Delete BASiCS_VarianceDecomp? 
  * Change plots to use ggplot2?
  * Should we separate BASiCS_TestDE in two functions? 
  * In plots, change axis labels to be text (no greek)?
  * Create 'no longer in use' message for selected functions. 
  * Implement change suggested by Giacomo Zanella
  * Store all necessary parameters for chain restart
  * Convert Rcpp print to messages ?
