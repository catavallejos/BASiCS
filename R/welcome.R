  removed the BASiCS-Data and BASiCS-D-Data class, the BASiCS_D_TestDE function uses two BASiCS-Chain class objects (Ref and Test) as input and the GeneName argument was removed, the BASiCS_Sim function now takes an extra 'mu_spikes' argument that contains the true number of input spike-in molecules (as used in the SpikeInput data.frame), 
  the makeExampleBASiCS_Data takes an extra argument 'Case1' that if set to TRUE simulates a dataset consisting of 50 biological genes and 10 technical genes."
